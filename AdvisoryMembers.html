Her aim is to help children and adults all over the world to learn systemic thinking in a playful way and to develop curricula together, to develop themselves further together and to increase intelligence and efficient communication as a global community in cooperation with artificial intelligence on the online platform to build  "FORMWELT Online".</p>

                          Gitta Peyn is co-founder of the FORMWELTen-Institut, Germany, which specializes in promoting innovative systemic and cybernetic thinking.

                                In 1996 I obtained my doctoral thesis entitled “Changes in the expression of intermediate filament genes in astroglia during rat brain development: Effect of exposure to ethanol”. In it I analyzed the events that occur during the early stages of astrogliogenesis during brain development, obtaining the outstanding grade "Cum Laude". The following year I was awarded the extraordinary doctorate award from the University of Valencia.
                                In 1997, I accessed the group of Dr. Eva Qwanstrom and Steve Dower at Hallamshire Hospital (University of Shefffiel, UK), where I remained for 3 and a half years identifying a regulatory subunit of the Interleukin-1 receptor. Working in immunology, cytokines, inflammation and cell matrix regulation processes.</p>

C. elegans was the first multi-cellular organism to have it genome mapped and the process of RNAi induced gene silencing was first discovered in this model. Work with C. elegans has resulted in award of Nobel Prize to six scientists for their pioneering work that has significantly aided in understanding of multiple biological processes including understanding of various human disease conditions.</p>
